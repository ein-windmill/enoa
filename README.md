##  Useage

Enoa including multiple subprojects, so it's not for solving a single thing. it needs to see what you need.
Anyway, you can through maven use enoa.

e.g.

**toolkit**

```xml
<dependency>  
 <groupId>io.enoa</groupId>  
 <artifactId>enoa-toolkit</artifactId>  
 <version>VERSION-ENOA</version>  
</dependency>
```

**yosart**

```xml
<dependency>  
 <groupId>io.enoa</groupId>  
 <artifactId>enoa-yosart</artifactId>  
 <version>VERSION-ENOA</version>  
</dependency>
```
